# Realtime-vehicle-Tracking

Real-time vehicle tracking in python using OpenCV can be implemented using computer vision algorithms. The program captures video frames from a camera or video file, processes the frames to detect vehicles, and tracks their movements. The detection and tracking algorithms use image processing techniques such as color-based blob detection, background subtraction, and object recognition algorithms. The position and trajectory of each vehicle is stored and displayed in real-time on a graph. This system can be used in various applications, such as traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicles, and vehicle security.
